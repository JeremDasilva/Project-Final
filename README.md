# Project-Final

*Cars sales analysis and prediction*

Final bootcamp project where I have decided to work on a used car dataset and perform analysis, machine learning and developing a web app on it.

## Data cleaning and preparation
A local database has first been created and can be enhanced at any moment. After retrieving data from it or from the csv, I have performed a cleaning in different step in order to have the dataset ready for analysis and machine learning.

## Machine learning
Maybe the most technical part of the project. The code could only be the last pieces at the end, but I wanted to show all the research part before reaching this point. We can see different engineering techniques like target and feature encoding or binning.

## Data visualization
The data visualization and analysis is contained within the web app. More visualisation could have been more done, especially if the database would have been dynamic in order to suits the user need.

## Web app
Streamlit web app where the user (client) can find the graphs he wants and statistics about some cars, but also get prediction (estimation) on a car he wants to sell or buy
